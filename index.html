    <h2 class="mt-5">Beyond Debate: Empowering Your Food Safety Decisions</h2>
    <p class="lead mt-4">The age-old debate about the "five-second rule" has left many in a conundrum: to eat or not to eat? With the <b>Five-Second Rule Filter</b>, we can finally shift from passive speculation to proactive action. Designed as a handy mobile device attachment, this tool serves a dual purpose. Not only does it quickly assess whether dropped food might be safe to eat by examining floor composition, cleanliness, and environmental factors like temperature and moisture, but it also employs ultraviolet light to sterilize certain foods. This means your dropped spaghetti might just make a safe return to your plate! In our modern world where every claim is scrutinized and debated, this tool stands as a testament to the power of decisive action in moving us beyond mere discussions.</p>
    <p class="lead">Why wonder about your floor's safety when the <b>Five-Second Rule Filter</b> can inform you in real-time? And it's not just floors – the device's versatility extends to various surfaces, from your dinner table to the utensils you use. By understanding and addressing potential contaminants, we're not just adhering to a five-second rule; we're redefining it. It's high time we leave behind outdated myths and bring empirical, actionable solutions right to our kitchen floors.</p>

        <p class="card-text small">Disclaimer: The Five-Second Rule Filter is designed to assist in evaluating the safety of dropped food based on specific parameters and conditions. While the device uses ultraviolet light to sterilize certain foods, it does not guarantee the complete removal of all contaminants or harmful microorganisms. Users are advised to exercise their own discretion and consider individual dietary and health factors before consuming dropped food. Regular cleaning and maintenance of the device are essential for optimal performance. Always refer to the user manual for detailed instructions and safety guidelines.</p>
        <p class="card-text small">While technologies similar to the components of this device are actively being researched and developed elsewhere, this product is still at the "speculative design" (<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262019842/speculative-everything/">Dunne & Raby, 2013</a>) stage—<a href="https://danielsgriffin.com/diss/extending_searching.html#search-seeds">from seeking <em>a material sign</em> that might be made searchable</a>—and is used as a "projectory" (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1353/tech.2015.0023">Messeri & Vertesi, 2015</a>) for engaging with "the problem of uncertainty" (<a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/sick-building-syndrome-and-the-problem-of-uncertainty">Murphy, 2006</a>). We strenuously note that that sometimes "strategic ignorance" (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13562517.2018.1547276">Bhatt & MacKenzie, 2019</a>) may be appropriate. (It may be the case that a simple rule, like a "Don't Touch Food That's Fallen on the Floor Rule" (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYXdsOEWBj0">Steven, 2012</a>), is more cost effective and this technology should be directed elsewhere. In that case we should perhaps identify the appropriate investment into limiting the amount of fallen food, though recognize that such a rule will affect people differentially.) At this present stage we hope to "highlight the interconnections and blurred boundaries between real and fictional, between the imaginary, research, and commercial development" (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3064663.3064682">Wong et al., 2017</a>). We can also do this “anticipation work” (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2675133.2675298">Steinhardt & Jackson, 2015</a>) to better see our present world and how "existing threats and systems of power" (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3322276.3323695">Fox et al., 2019</a>) function to make various things and ideas more or less searchable and visible. We look forward "to work[ing] with others to imagine and create alternatives to the <em>techno quo</em>" (<a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/j.ctv11sn78h">Benjamin, 2019</a>).</p>
